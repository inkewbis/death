    <h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Hello, my name is Raelyn, but everyone just calls me Rae. I am a purple belt in Jiu Jitsu.
    I used to play in a death metal band, but I decided to leave so that I can be more focused on my studies.
I am majroing in computer science at the moment.
This is my first semester here at Cerritos College which is exciting. I plan to transfer to UC Irvine if everything 
goes well. I am a chef and I was pursuing music before I decided to go back to school. So far it's a 
    little overwhelming, but also rewarding. </p>
