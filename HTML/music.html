    <h1>Music Journey</h1>
    <p> I started playing music at a very young age. I was self taught on the piano and later joined band. I chose to play the trumpet in 6th grade. From there I got to play at some pretty prestigious places such as Carnegie Hall, The Great Wall of China, I got to play for the queen of London and the Rose Parade. From there I just started teaching myself how to play other instruments like the guitar and drums. I got into singing and was later signed onto a small record label. From there I joined a couple of bands, but later decided to focus more on school. </p>
